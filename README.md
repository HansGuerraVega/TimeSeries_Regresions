# Project Description
Sweet Lift Taxi has collected historical data on taxi requests at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi requests for the next hour. Build a model for this prediction.

The RECM metric on the test set should not exceed 48.

## Project Instructions
Download the data and resample it so that each data point in the original data falls within one-hour intervals.
Analyze the data.
Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial data set.
Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.

## Data Description
The data is stored in the taxi.csv file.

The number of orders is in the num_orders column.
